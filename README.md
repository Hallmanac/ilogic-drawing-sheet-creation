# ilogic-drawing-sheet-creation
A quick WinForm driven iLogic rule that enhances the sheet creation dialog. This was done for Inventor 2011.

This was something that was put together as kind of a proof of concept or MVP (Minimum Viable Product) back in 2010. This was done in a couple of days, a video was made on YouTube, and then it was forgotten. Take the code you see with a grain of salt. 

Here's the YouTube video link:
